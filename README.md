# AI based projects

## Detecting Combined Identities 
With the advent of AI, we can now create digital doppelgangers of anyone with just some hours of videos given as input for training. One of the papers presented in Siggraph’17 titled “Synthesizing Obama: Lip sync from Audio”.
I used GANs to generate the morphed images/videos and used Deep Learning models like VGG'16 to detect forgery in images. [[Report Link]](https://github.com/aksh98/BiometricsProject/blob/master/Project\%20Report.pdf)

## Github User Recommendation system 
Recommended Github Users for Github Projects/Organizations based on the user's activities in Github and StackOverflow.

## Audio Super-Resolution 
Used 5 Machine Learning models (GANs, Hidden Markov Model, AutoEncoder, Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Network) to generate a high resolution signal from a low resolution audio with a smaller sampling rate. [[Github Link]](https://github.com/aksh98/Audio_super_Resolution)

## Augmented Reality Helmets for kids 
Made interactive helmets to make kids' journeys interesting and informational. A step to reduce accident deaths due to absence of helmets in pillion riders [[Github Link]](https://github.com/aksh98/ARHelmetForKids)

## 2D to 3D 
A system that creates a 3D scene using objects synthesized from paper drawings and sketches.[[Github Link]](https://github.com/aksh98/2D-to-3D)

## Ishaara: Gesture Controller App 
Made flex sensor gloves which detects hand gestures and automatically controls other apps in the phone such as music, contacts etc. [[Project Link]](http://iedprojects2016.blogspot.com/2016/05/title-gesture-based-communication.html?+view=sidebar)

## Gender Prediction using Handwriting
Applied feature extraction techniques required for writer prediction through handwriting analysis. We then used some classifiers on the feature set and also compared the performance of these classifiers with and without some image transformation techniques.

## Safe-First: Safety Device for Women 
A safety device which sends alert to 5 emergency contacts on receiving a pre-defined custom gesture notifying danger.

# Development 

## Krishi-Seva (Farmer Friendly app)
It's a smart web-app for farmers which recommends crops according to the data collected by ICAR, the climatic conditions and the water availability in that area. You can also buy/sell your crops using that app. [[Github Link]](https://github.com/aksh98/Krishi-Seva)

## Rental Management System 
A Django-based WebApp to find the appropriate rentals for the user.[[Github Page]](https://github.com/aksh98/Rental_Management_System)

## DBLP Query Engine in java
Complex query engine to retrieve information from DBLP dataset.[[Github Link]](https://github.com/aksh98/DBLP-Query-Engine/)
